# Pokemon Card Recognition - Side Project Plan

## Project Overview
A simple, free side project to identify Pokemon cards using your phone's camera. Focus on basic recognition and card information display.

## Simplified Scope

### Core Features (MVP Only)
1. **Camera/Upload**: Take photo or upload image of Pokemon card
2. **Basic Recognition**: Identify card by name using OCR
3. **Card Info Display**: Show basic card details (name, HP, type, attacks)
4. **Simple Collection**: Add cards to a basic list

### What We're NOT Building (Yet)
- Pricing data
- Advanced ML models
- Social features
- AR features
- Complex collection management
- Market integration

## Free Tech Stack

### Frontend Options
**React Native (Recommended)**

- Large free library ecosystem
- Easy camera integration

**Alternative: Progressive Web App**
- React + TypeScript
- Works in browser
- Free hosting on GitHub Pages/Vercel
- Limited camera access on mobile

### Backend (Optional - Can Start Local-Only)
**Local-First Approach**
- SQLite database on device
- No server costs
- Works offline
- Simple file-based storage

**Free Backend Options (if needed later)**
- **Firebase Free Tier**: 1GB storage, 50,000 reads/day
- **Supabase Free Tier**: 500MB database, 50,000 API calls
- **Railway Free Tier**: $5 credit monthly
- **Render Free Tier**: Static sites and basic web services

### Free Services & APIs
- **Pokemon TCG API**: Free, no authentication required
- **Tesseract.js**: Free OCR library
- **Google ML Kit**: Free for mobile apps
- **GitHub**: Free code hosting
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Free hosting for web apps

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic App (2-3 weeks)
**Goal**: Simple camera app that can identify cards by name

**Steps**:
1. Set up React Native project
2. Add camera functionality
3. Implement basic OCR using Tesseract.js or Google ML Kit
4. Create simple card database (start with 100-200 popular cards)
5. Basic UI to display card info

**Free Tools**:
- React Native CLI (free)
- Expo Camera (free)
- Tesseract.js (free)
- SQLite for React Native (free)

### Phase 2: Improve Recognition (2-3 weeks)
**Goal**: Better accuracy and more cards

**Steps**:
1. Add image preprocessing (brightness, contrast adjustment)
2. Expand card database to 1000+ cards
3. Improve OCR accuracy with better image handling
4. Add manual card selection if OCR fails

**Free Tools**:
- OpenCV.js (free)
- Image manipulation libraries (free)

### Phase 3: Polish & Deploy (1-2 weeks)
**Goal**: Better UI and app store ready

**Steps**:
1. Improve UI/UX design
2. Add collection management
3. Test on real devices
4. Prepare for app store submission

## Database Structure (Simplified)

```sql
-- Simple card database (start with CSV file)
cards (
  id, name, set_name, card_number, 
  hp, types, attacks, image_url
)

-- User collection (local storage)
user_collection (
  card_id, quantity, date_added
)
```

## Free Data Sources

### Pokemon Card Data
- **Pokemon TCG API**: Free, comprehensive card database
- **Pokemon.com**: Scrape basic card info (respect robots.txt)
- **Manual Entry**: Start with 50-100 popular cards

### Card Images
- **Pokemon TCG API**: Provides official card images
- **Fair Use**: Use for educational/non-commercial purposes
- **User Uploads**: Let users provide their own images

## Development Timeline

### Week 1-2: Setup & Camera
- Set up React Native development environment
- Implement camera functionality
- Basic app structure

### Week 3-4: OCR & Recognition
- Integrate Tesseract.js or Google ML Kit
- Create basic card database
- Implement card matching logic

### Week 5-6: UI & Polish
- Design and implement user interface
- Add collection management
- Testing and bug fixes

### Week 7-8: Deploy & Launch
- Prepare for app store submission
- Create app store listings
- Launch and gather feedback

## Cost Breakdown

### Development Costs: $0
- All tools and libraries are free
- Development on personal computer
- Free hosting and deployment options

### Potential Future Costs (Optional)
- **App Store Developer Account**: $99/year (only if you want to publish)
- **Better OCR Service**: $0-50/month (if you need higher accuracy)
- **Cloud Storage**: $0-10/month (if you need to store user data)

## Getting Started Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install React Native CLI
npm install -g react-native-cli

# Create new project
npx react-native init PokemonCardScanner

# Or use Expo (easier for beginners)
npx create-expo-app PokemonCardScanner
```

### 2. Essential Libraries
```bash
# Camera functionality
npm install react-native-camera
# or for Expo
expo install expo-camera

# OCR library
npm install tesseract.js

# Local database
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

## Success Metrics (Simplified)

### Technical Goals
- **Recognition Accuracy**: >80% for clear cards
- **Processing Speed**: <5 seconds
- **App Size**: <50MB
- **Battery Usage**: Minimal impact

### Personal Goals
- **Learning**: Gain experience with React Native, OCR, and mobile development
- **Portfolio**: Add to your development portfolio
- **Fun**: Enjoy building something useful for Pokemon fans
- **Community**: Share with other developers and Pokemon enthusiasts

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Challenges
1. **OCR Accuracy**: Start with clear, well-lit cards only
2. **Camera Issues**: Provide manual upload option
3. **Performance**: Keep app simple, optimize images

### Time Management
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features only
2. **Perfectionism**: Launch with basic functionality, improve later
3. **Motivation**: Set small, achievable milestones

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Platform**: React Native vs PWA
2. **Set Up Environment**: Install development tools
3. **Create Basic App**: Camera + simple UI
4. **Add OCR**: Start with Tesseract.js
5. **Build Card Database**: Start with 50 popular cards
6. **Test & Iterate**: Improve based on real usage
